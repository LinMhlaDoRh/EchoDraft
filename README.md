# EchoDraft

Turn one pillar piece into five platform-native drafts that still sound like you.

EchoDraft learns your writing voice from a few samples, then repurposes any long-form
content into ready-to-post drafts for **LinkedIn, X, Instagram, YouTube, and email**
checking each one for authenticity and letting you refine individual drafts on demand.

## Features

- **Voice profile** paste 3–5 writing samples and EchoDraft extracts your tone,
  vocabulary, sentence rhythm, and personal do’s and don’ts.
- **Five platform drafts in one step** a single request produces a LinkedIn post,
  an X thread, an Instagram caption, a YouTube description, and an email newsletter,
  each written to that platform’s format.
- **Authenticity check** every draft gets a local authenticity score that flags
  generic, robotic phrasing. No network calls are needed for scoring.
- **Refine one draft at a time** open **Tweak** on any card (“make it punchier”,
  “cut 20%”, “more casual”) and only that draft is regenerated.
- **Copy or export** copy a single draft, or export all five as a `.txt` file.

## Tech stack

- Next.js (App Router) + React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Google Gemini for voice analysis and generation

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # add your keys
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000, build a voice profile, then paste a pillar piece and generate.

> Without a `GEMINI_API_KEY`, the app runs offline with built-in sample drafts, so you
> can explore the full flow before adding a key.

## Environment variables

Set these in `.env.local` (never commit real secrets):

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | For live output | Server-side Gemini key. Never prefix with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`. |
| `GEMINI_MODEL` | Optional | Model name (defaults to `gemini-2.5-flash`). |
| `ECHODRAFT_API_TOKEN` | In production | Protects the API routes. Generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`. |
| `ECHODRAFT_SESSION_SECRET` | Optional | Separate cookie-signing secret (defaults to `ECHODRAFT_API_TOKEN`). |
| `ECHODRAFT_RATE_LIMIT_MAX` | Optional | Requests allowed per window (default 20). |
| `ECHODRAFT_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS` | Optional | Rate-limit window in ms (default 60000). |

In production, API routes are protected: browser visitors receive a signed httpOnly
session cookie automatically, and automated callers must send the API token via
`x-echodraft-token` or `Authorization: Bearer`. A spoofed `Origin` is never sufficient.

## Scripts

```bash
npm run dev         # start the dev server
npm run build       # production build
npm start           # run the production build
npm run typecheck   # TypeScript type checking
npm run lint        # lint
npm test            # run the test suite
```

## How it was built

EchoDraft was built for the IBM AI Builders Challenge. The AI pair-programming
session log is preserved in [`docs/ibm-bob-chat-history.md`](docs/ibm-bob-chat-history.md).
